## Description

Job Seeker is an application created with React Native which uses a third party API (JSearch) to fetch data of jobs the user might be interested on. It is able to display jobs nearby, popular jobs, full-time, part-time, and contractor jobs. The app will look for React Developer jobs in the US as a default unless the user uses the search bar to search for a specific job at a specific location (the data for jobs outside of the US might be formatted differently resulting in all the data being rendered in the "About" section. The user also has the option to tap the "Apply fo job" button which will take them to the actual job posting. This project was my introduction to React Native, and it helped me get familiar with how React Native works and the different elements available when creating a mobile application without the use of HTML. It also introduced me to useful tools such as Expo and Metro bundler and it taught me some of the best practices that can be used when creating an application.

## Installation

The app has not been released on the app store, therefore, it cannot be oppened unless the code itself is downloaded. If so, the command `npm install` must be ran to install all dependencies, then `npm run web` to open the application locally.

## Usage

This app can be used to browse different jobs in an organized and efficient manner. It allows the user to read all the details related to the job and apply to it by being re-directed to the job posting itself.
